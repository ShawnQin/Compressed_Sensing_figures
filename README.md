This repository contains the MATLAB scripts generating figures in the paper "Optimal compressed sensing strategies for an array of nonlinear olfactory receptor neurons with and without spontaneous activity"

Scripts of individual plots are in the folder `plot`. You need to download tthe `data` and put it under the main directory. The data can downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kONCqG5dYnZ5CGpU1jgRJKaRElHv6Ye9?usp=drive_link)
